How do chip tournaments work? Every player is given an amount of chips based on their skill level. Better players will receive fewer chips. Not so good players will receive more chips. The initial tables are populated randomly. The two players play a game. Loser stays. Winner stays and racks for the incoming player. When a player loses, they lose a chip and their spot at the table is filled with another opponent from the pool of waiting players. The winner of the table does not win a chip, but stays at the table and does not lose a chip.

Script has special functions.
"done" ends the tournament
"chips" shows how many chips each person in the field has
"tables" shows who is currently playing
